I am currently a senior at the College of William & Mary, double-majoring in Economics and Government. My research interests include developmental economics, applied microeconomics, macroeconomics, and human rights. I am delighted to become a pre-doctoral fellow with the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR), with Professor Neale Mahoney, this upcoming summer. 

I live in Williamsburg, VA--before living in the United States, I had lived in Japan for a total of 12 years. There I developed a passion for understanding the divergence in economic growth between countries, the relationship between economics and human rights, and international politics in general. When not studying, I enjoy playing tennis, playing the piano, drawing, and reading political history.
