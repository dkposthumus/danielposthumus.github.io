I am currently a pre-doctoral research fellow with Professor Neale Mahoney at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR). I am currently working on projects related to the political economy, housing, and industrial organization (in particular productivity and retail gasoline markets). My CV can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U_l_7NeHpQruPuqk6C6Wknoyj7l8fvNX/view?usp=sharing). You can check out some of my short-form writing [here](https://substack.com/@danielposthumu2?utm_campaign=profile&utm_medium=profile-page).

On a personal note, I love playing tennis, reading, history, watching movies, obsessing over politics, exploring the texture of urban life, and (in true California fashion) cycling.
