I am currently a pre-doctoral research fellow with Professor Neale Mahoney and Ryan Cummings at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR). I am currently working on projects related to Industrial Organization in California gasoline markets, consumer sentiment, and voting behavior.

I am passionate about questions in developmental economics, institutions, housing, and urbanism. On a personal note, I love playing tennis, reading, obsessing over politics, exploring the texture of urban life, and (in true California fashion) cycling.
