I am currently a senior at the College of William & Mary, double-majoring in Economics and Government. My research interests include developmental economics, applied microeconomics, and human rights. I am delighted to become a pre-doctoral fellow with the Stanford Institue for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR), with Professor Neale Mahoney.
