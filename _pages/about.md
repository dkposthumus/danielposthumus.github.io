I am currently a pre-doctoral research fellow with Professor Neale Mahoney and Ryan Cummings at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR). I am currently working on projects related to Industrial Organization in California gasoline markets, housing, and political economy. My CV can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wAXzClwzIsLZO8WAs09IDrxVP6hGn6se/view?usp=sharing). 

On a personal note, I love playing tennis, reading, history, obsessing over politics, exploring the texture of urban life, and (in true California fashion) cycling.
