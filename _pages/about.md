I am currently a pre-doctoral research fellow with Professor Neale Mahoney at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR). I am currently working on projects related to the political economy, housing, and industrial organization (in particular productivity and retail gasoline markets). My CV can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rNDbdbki0cW_wVZ3nc4b5J_w3y-X7vo6/view?usp=sharing).

On a personal note, I love playing tennis, reading, history, watching movies, obsessing over politics, exploring the texture of urban life, and (in true California fashion) cycling.
