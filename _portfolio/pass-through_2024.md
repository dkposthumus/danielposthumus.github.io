title: "The Pass-Through of Changes in Monetary Policy to Borrowing Costs"
excerpt: "The Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy in a variety of different ways, but the most common is by adjusting the Target Federal Funds Rate. By changing its policy rate, the Federal Reserve can change the costs of borrowing in the economy, although different interest rates respond to changes in the policy rate very differently. In order to test the pass-through of changes to the federal reserve policy rate (here we limit ourselves to conventional monetary policy making), we will engage in a three-pronged empirical approach: 1) a cross-sectional regression of changes in various borrowing costs in conjunction with the policy rate, 2) a vector auto-regressive (VAR) approach, and 3) a structural auto-regressive (SVAR) approach that borrows heavily from the work of Pétursson."

*Note: This project was initially a group project (my group members were Joseph Sleeper, Ellie Wess, and Vernal Crosley) completed for an undergraduate economics course "Capital Markets" with Professor Zhao Han. I have replaced all work completed by my groupmates with my own, and kept the part of the initial project that I completed by myself.*
