title: "Starting Early: Returns on Kindergarten Attendance in Indonesia"
excerpt: "For my Honors Thesis in Economics, I am completing a project titled Starting Early, Returns on Kindergarten Attendance in Indonesia. I am focusing on the effects of kindergarten attendance on educational outcomes in Indonesia, employing mother fixed-effects and instrumental variable (IV) estimation. I find there is no statistically significant effect of kindergarten attendance on medium- and long-term educational outcomes, while there is some evidence of significant effects on short-term educational outcomes. This finding echoes a popular concept from the literature on early childhood interventions, fadeout, or the fading out of early childhood programs' effects as children age and advance in the educational system."

I had the incredible opportunity to present my project at the 2024 National Collegiate Research Conference (NCRC), hosted by the Harvard Conference on Undergraduate Research (HCURA). There, from January 19-21, I presented a poster summarizing on my progress and up-to-date findings. You can find my poster [here](https://github.com/dkposthumus/danielposthumus.github.io/blob/master/_portfolio/honors-thesis_2024/poster_posthumus_final.pdf).

*Note: I want to thank my Thesis Advisor, Professor Ranjan Shrestha, for his tremendous support and counsel throughout my project. I also want to thank the William & Mary Charles Center, Economics Department, and 1693 Scholarship for their support of my travels for this project.*
