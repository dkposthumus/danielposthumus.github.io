title: "Starting Early: Returns on Kindergarten Attendance in Indonesia"
excerpt: "For my Honors Thesis in Economics, I am completing a project titled Starting Early, Returns on Kindergarten Attendance in Indonesia. I am focusing on the effects of kindergarten attendance on educational outcomes in Indonesia, employing mother fixed-effects and instrumental variable (IV) estimation. My findings are very mixed. Using mother fixed-effects, I find no significant effect of kindergarten on years of education, or completion of elementary or junior high school. However, utilizing IV estimation--my instruments are the number of kindergartens per 10,000 resident in each kecamatan in 1) 1990 and 2) 2000, I find very strong effects of kindergarten attendance. In particular, my model suggests attending kindergarten results in the completion of 1.5 additional years of education. I plan on extending this research to studies of wage effects and the effects of kindergarten on other educational outcomes."

I had the incredible opportunity to present my project at the 2024 National Collegiate Research Conference (NCRC), hosted by the Harvard Conference on Undergraduate Research (HCURA). There, from January 19-21, I presented a poster summarizing on my progress and up-to-date findings. You can find my poster [here](https://github.com/dkposthumus/danielposthumus.github.io/blob/master/_portfolio/honors-thesis_2024/poster_posthumus_final.pdf).

An adaptation of my presentation at NCRC 2024 can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlAdx8bTmFc).

On March 22, 2024, I had the opportunity to present my Thesis at William & Mary's Spring 2024 Graduate and Honors Research Symposium. There I presented the slideshow that can be found [here](https://github.com/dkposthumus/danielposthumus.github.io/blob/master/_portfolio/honors-thesis_2024/ghrs_posthumus.pdf).

*Note: I want to thank my Thesis Advisor, Professor Ranjan Shrestha, for his tremendous support and counsel throughout my project. I also want to thank the William & Mary Charles Center, Economics Department, and 1693 Scholarship for their support of my travels for this project.*
