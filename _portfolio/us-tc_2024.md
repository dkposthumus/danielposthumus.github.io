title: "Truth Commissions and Transitional Justice in the United States"
excerpt: "This project is the result of my work with Dr. Kelebogile Zvobgo and Zoha Siddiqui as part of the International Justice Labs. We are examining US Truth Commissions' adoption and design, a novel subject for human rights, and specifically transitional justice, researchers. With Dr. Zvobgo, I published Democratizing Truth in 2021, and now Zoha, Dr. Zvobgo, and I are working on a new project seeking to understand the role of public opinion in US truth commission design and adopion."

This project began with my work as a Research Fellow with the International Justice Lab ([IJL](https://www.internationaljusticelab.org/)) my first year of undergraduate. I started with compiling data to understand the most prominent case of US truth commission--the Commmittee on Wartime Relocation Internment of Civilians (CWRIC). From there, the project expanded and [Dr. Kelebogile Zvobgo](https://www.zvobgo.com/) and I published the paper ["Democratizing Truth"](https://dkposthumus.github.io/danielposthumus.github.io/publication/2021-democratizing-truth) in the *International Journal of Transitional Justice* in 2021. In that paper, we introduced a dataset of past, present, and proposed truth commissions in the United States, an under-studied area.

That paper laid the groundwork for continued study of US Truth Commission. Working with the Sharp Fellowship Program at William & Mary, I had the opportunity to publish an [article](https://dkposthumus.github.io/danielposthumus.github.io/publication/2022-iowa-pulitzer) focusing on the Iowa City Truth Commission with the Pulitzer Center. 

Now, Dr. Zvobgo, [Zoha Siddiqui](http://zohasiddiqui.org/), and I are working on a project examining the processes of truth commission adoption in the US, in particular the role of public opinion in shaping truth commission adoption and design. We're working on updating the dataset introduced in "Democratizing Truth" and building the first comprehensive dataset on US truth commission mandates.

*I want to thank Dr. Zvobgo for the opportunity to work in the International Justice Lab, and for her continued mentor and guidance throughout my academic career. I also want to thank my co-author Zoha Siddiqui for her continued efforts on our current project.*
