title: "Bond Yield Decomposition - Dynamic Term Structural Models (DTSM), Approaches and Challenges"
excerpt: "In this paper, I examine one structural model that has been used to answer questions related to the effects of quantitative easing and its transmission channels, the dynamic term structural model (DTSM). In particular, I will focus on the use of DTSM, first by Kim and Wright (2005) and then by Rudebusch and Bauer (2014). DTSM is used to decompose bond yields into two portions: the term premia, capturing the premium paid for having a bond with an $n$-year maturity, and the expected interest rate over the $n$ years of the bond's maturity. Thus, the changes to these components of a bond's yield are critical for deciphering the relative importance of different transmission channels of QE policy. I describe shortcomings of the model, criticisms posed by the literature, and other possible applications of it."
