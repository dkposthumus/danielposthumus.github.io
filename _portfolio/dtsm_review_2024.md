title: "Bond Yield Decomposition - Dynamic Term Structural Models (DTSM), Approaches and Challenges"
excerpt: "In this paper, I will focus on one structural model that has been used to answer this research question--the dynamic term structural model (DTSM). In particular, I will focus on the employment of the model, first by Kim and Wright (2005) and then by Rudebusch and Bauer (2014). In short, the structural model is used to decompose bond yields into two portions: the term premia, capturing the premium paid for having a bond with an $n$-year maturity, and the expected interest rate over the $n$ years of the bond's maturity. Thus, the changes to these components of a bond's yield are critical for deciphering the relative importance of different transmission channels of QE policy."
